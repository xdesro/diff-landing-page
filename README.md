## ⚙ Prerequisites

- Node `v12.5.0`
- NPM `v6.9.1`

## 🎉 Getting Started

The site is a pretty simple HTML & CSS project, and uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) bundler for quick and dirty asset management.

1. 📦 Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. 🚧 Serve the app locally and watch for changes. (Parcel will throw up a dev server at `localhost:1234`.)

```sh
npm run start
```

3. 🏗 Build the app. (This'll generate files in `dist` but won't start a server or anything).

```sh
npm run build
```
